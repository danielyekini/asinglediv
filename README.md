# A Single Div Experiments

This repository is a playground for creating illustrations using a single HTML `<div>` and CSS.
It draws inspiration from [Lynn Fisher's](https://a.singlediv.com/) **A Single Div** project,
which demonstrates how much can be accomplished with minimal markup.

## What's in this repo?

- **index.html** – the main page that loads the examples of single-div art.
- **css/** – stylesheets for the layout and individual illustrations. Each design is built with
  one `<div>` element and creatively styled pseudo-elements.

Currently, the page showcases:

- A spider suspended from its web.
- A concentric-circle lollipop.

## Viewing the examples

No build steps are required. Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser or serve the
repository with a lightweight static server:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the artwork.

## Inspiration

All credit for the single-div concept goes to Lynn Fisher's delightful gallery
at [a.singlediv.com](https://a.singlediv.com/). This repo is an educational exercise built
in that spirit.
